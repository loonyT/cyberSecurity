# cyberSecurity
Repo with resources and codes about cybersecurity, which would be the field i would like to work in later. 

 With the reading of the following book : https://www.amazon.com/Web-Security-Developers-Malcolm-McDonald/dp/1593279949 i learned how to, for instance : 

  •  Protect against SQL injection attacks, malicious JavaScript, and cross-site request forgery
  •  Add authentication and shape access control to protect accounts
  •  Lock down user accounts to prevent attacks that rely on guessing passwords, stealing sessions,
  •  or escalating privileges
  •  Implement encryption
  •  Manage vulnerabilities in legacy code
  •  Prevent information leaks that disclose vulnerabilities
  •  Mitigate advanced attacks like malvertising and denial-of-service
